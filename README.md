# ObjectOrientedProgramming net8.0

Репозиторий посвящен понимаю шаблонов и принципов программирования в парадигме ООП

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Every class should have only one reason to change

Open–Closed Principle (OCP)
The open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtype Requirement: Let ϕ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T
then ϕ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The interface segregation principle states that the interface of a program
should be split in a way that the user/client would only have access to the necessary methods related to their needs

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules
Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces)
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions
