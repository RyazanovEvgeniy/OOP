Репозиторий посвящен понимаю шаблонов и принципов программирования в парадигме ООП

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP))</br>
Every class should have only one reason to change

Open–Closed Principle (OCP))</br>
The open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</br>
Subtype Requirement: Let ϕ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T</br>
then ϕ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP))</br>
The interface segregation principle states that the interface of a program)</br>
should be split in a way that the user/client would only have access to the necessary methods related to their needs

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP))</br>
High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules)</br>
Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces))</br>
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions
